# ChatMail
**Author**: Marc-Antoine Aug√©

## Why this application?
Every mail application available on the Android store is too much complicated. They are buttons everywhere and you don't know that they do (only a small icon helps you). If your finger stay too long pressed or if it moves inadvertently in the wrong place, your screen will completly change and it's easy to be lost.

Moreover, looking for a contact, send pictures is too complicated for someone who doesn't care about all the possibilities of the app.

This mail application is very easy to use: few colored and bigs buttons with caption, display mails as a chat application. It's even possible to add pictures directly inside the app.

**This app is used everyday since December 2018.**

## Technologies
This project uses one backend (__ChatBox__ - in `Node`) which stores the mails from the Mail provider (e.g. Gmail) and provides an easy API used by the frontend (__ChatMail__ - in `Ionic`).
